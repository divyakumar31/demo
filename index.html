                    <div class="about-text">
                        Hello, I'm a computer engineering student in 2nd year at L. D. College of Engineering. I have
                        experience in working with various programming languages and technologies such as HTML, CSS,
                        Flask, Java,
                        Python, SQL, etc. I have also completed several mini projects and participated in hackathon.
                        Some of my
                        projects include a word counter web application. You can check out my projects and skills in
                        this website.
                        <br><br>
                        I'm always eager to learn new things and explore new challenges in the field of computer
                        engineering. I'm also interested in collaborating with other developers. I believe that computer
                        engineering is
                        not only about writing code, but also about solving real-world problems and creating value for
                        the
                        users. I'm looking forward to applying my knowledge and skills in future projects and
                        opportunities.
